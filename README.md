# Advent_of_Code

This is my first Advent of Code. As someone who likes low level learning I decided to also do a random language every day.
I'm much less skilled that he is so I only chose 4 languages: C, C++, Java and Python. With a slight bias to C++ cause I'm going to be using it next year for a data structures class

Here's the language for each day:

1st: C++

2nd: C++

3rd: C++

4th: Java
