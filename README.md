# Advent_of_Code

As someone who likes low level learning I decided to also do a random language every day.

I'm much less skilled that he is so I only chose 4 languages: C++, Java, JS and Python.

Here's the language for each day (2023):

1st: C++

2nd: C++

3rd: C++

4th: Java

5th: Java

6th: JS

7th: JS

8th: C++

9th: Python

10th: JS

11th: Python

12th: Java

13th: Python

14th: Python

15th: Java

16th: Java

17th: JS

18th: JS

19th: Java

20th: Python

21st: Python

22nd: Java

23rd: Java

24th: Python

25th: C++
